-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A new .git file is created where your repository is going to be stored and that's why it is necessary to create it. 

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is located between the working directory and the git repository, it is different
because it is an area for preparing the things that are going to be comitted, so it offers a space
to add the files to a temporary area.
