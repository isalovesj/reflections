-When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?
Because sometimes you need to work from a remote place, or with people that need access to the files
you're working with.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because not every change you made is supposed to stay or be right at all, so it is better to decide when to pull changes to your local repository manually.
